        <h2>An HTML Document is Just a Bunch of Text</h2>
        <p>Since an HTML document essentially consists of just a bunch of text, it is at the mercy of the interpreter.<br><br>Accordingly, some funky simplifying rules have been developed, which help create a semi-reliable way of rendering HTML into graphics accross platforms - it's not perfect, but still a really amazing level of coordination if you compare it to pretty much anything other human endeavour. Some of these rules are:
          <ul>
           <li>Everything is a box</li>
           <li>Elements nest within one-another, with the most local rules supercedeing the more global</li>
           <li>Each element may have one or more specified styles</li>
         </ul>          
      </div>
      <div class = "point" id="2">
        <h2>The Importance of Avoiding Repetition</h2>
          <p>"I'm so DRY right now." I had a friend that used to say that all the time... I had no idea that she was a programmer. *rimshot*<br>... but seriously, that's a thing, from the east coast in Canada, and it totally doesn't mean what you think... or maybe it does.</p>
          <p>I don't like the complexity, or the redundancy that comes with repeating myself -- how I am I supposed to create really cool things if I have to be redundant?<br><br>I would much rather think in rules, boxes, abstractions, than spend my time re-doing something that a <a href="http://demotivators.despair.com/demotivational/motivationdemotivator.jpg" target="_blank">robot could have done.</a></p>
          <p>Don't repeat yourself isn't a programming principle, it's a way of life.</p>

        <h2>Basic HTML and CSS Knowledge</h2>
          <p>Things I know and find useful include:
            <ul>
             <li>Inheritance:<ul>
               <li>More specific (lower-level) items supercede higher-order items, just like classes and subclasses. This means <em>in-line</em> > block styles. For the record, I don't think it's a coincidence that CSS uses curly-braces.</li>
               <li>Everything is easier the more centralized it is -- defaulting to higher-order styling looks better because it's more consistent and is easier to manage. If we consider that things that look familiar tend to look better, does that create a self-fulfilling prophecy? I say yes.</li>
                <li>You can also earn money using this kind of inheritance.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Tools:<ul>
              <li>I started this particular project on Codepen. That was a pain, SublimeText is just way easier to work with.</li>
              <li>The Mozilla reference is ridiculous and hard to use, I much prefer to Google "#{query} w3school".</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Misc:<ul>
              <li>"stylesheet" is an <em>attribute</em> of the rel <em>property</em> in the "link" <em>tag</em>... I'm not sure I have all that terminology right.</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul>
        <p>Things I would like to learn / figure out:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What the best way to make nested lists is.</li>
            <li>How to make those cool "jump to heading" links like the demo site had</li>
            <li>If there is a way to write a tag in a text area and have it display</li>
            <li>If there is a way to link text to replicate it - eg. with the table of context that links to areas in the article, can you write the text once and have it auto-update... how?</li>
          </ul>

      <p>
        THIS IS A FOOTER -- YAY SEMANTIC ELEMENTS<br>
        I do feel like putting the footer in a |p| might be a bit superfluous for these particular purposes...

          THIS IS A SPAN, BUT ALSO A FOOTER, BUT IT'S IN A DIV... whaaaa??
